# Game_Dont-Stop-Yell
This repository features basic scripts for a highly engaging game that gained significant popularity a few years back.  

It's a creative title where players control their in-game character through voice commands â€“ specifically, by adjusting their voice volume. Developed with Unity, these scripts are designed for Unity projects, enabling voice volume detection and triggering character movement when the volume reaches a sufficient level.
